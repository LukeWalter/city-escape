# Escape Simulator

## Problem Description

Shenanigans are afoot at the Atlanta zoo! A new shipment of bananas is being brought in to supply food to all of the primate exhibits. Since the zookeepers are asleep, Madu the orangutan is making an attempt to escape from her habitat and hijack the operation so she can hoard them all for her fellow orangutans. This is a morally questionable thing for Madu to do, so it is our job as habitat designers to make the likelihood of her success as low as possible.

Our goal for this problem is to design a simulation that can model Madu's escape attempt and determine whether or not she succeeds. From there, we can calculate the probability of her success in a given environment.

## Rules of the Simulation

1. Madu's habitat will be represented by a two-dimensional grid. At the start of any test run, Madu should start at the center of the grid.
